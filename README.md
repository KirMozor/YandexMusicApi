### _Cross-platform Yandex Music API for C#_


Is the alteration of the unofficial [API YandexMusic on Python](https://github.com/MarshalX/yandex-music-api)

##### _Why did you create this library if there are others already?_
[Of course, there are plugs of this API for C#](https://github.com/Winster332/Yandex.Music.Api)

But the author stopped continuing to develop this library.
[There is her fork](https://github.com/Winster332/Yandex.Music.Api), but the library is not cross-platform, and when I asked the author to make it under Linux, he said that I should do it myself

At the moment, the library that I am developing is not available in Nuget, because it is not ready
