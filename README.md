# YandexMusicApi

### _Cross-platform C# API for Yandex.Music_

It's a C# variant of an another [Yandex.Music API for Python.](https://github.com/MarshalX/yandex-music-api)

##### _Why did you create this library if there are others already?_
[Of course, there are other wrappers.](https://github.com/Winster332/Yandex.Music.Api)
But the author discontinued this library.
[There is a fork](https://github.com/Winster332/Yandex.Music.Api), but the library is not cross-platform, and when I asked the author to make it under Linux, he said that I should do it myself.

### How to install?
`dotnet add PROJECT package YandexMusicApi`
